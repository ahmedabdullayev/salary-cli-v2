# Documentation
The task is to write a command line application (CLI application), the input of which is the year and the output is a table with the date of payment of each month's salary and the date of sending the reminder to the accountant (12 lines in total and the table header).

### Technologies
- Laravel 8
- Laravel Excel

### How to use?
Install my app, open console, run command: **php artisan start:command**
Then input a year(for example: **2022**), write **yes**
And finnaly you are going to get xlsx file with salary dates in **storage/app/salaries** folder

### Output after the success input(for 2022 year)
As you can see payment date is on 01-07 not on 01-08, because we have holiday on this date which is on our holidays array.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
